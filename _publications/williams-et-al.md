excerpt: '[In Preparation] This paper examines the empirical foundations of widely adopted visualization guidelines by juxtaposing academic literature with practitioner-oriented style guides. We began by identifying a set of widely cited guidelines, drawn from publicly available style guides and design manuals. We then conducted a structured review of empirical studies, categorizing each study according to whether it provided direct, partial, or conflicting evidence for a given guideline. Our analysis reveals which guidelines are supported by evidence, which lack validation, and which show mixed or context-dependent results, and highlights the need for more critical reflection on how design advice is communicated and applied. We conclude by discussing challenges in aligning research and practice and advocate for stronger collaborations between researchers and practitioners to develop harmonized, evidence-informed visualization standards.'
