excerpt: ' Effective data visualization requires thoughtful design choices, but practitioners often face conflicting recommendations across different style guides. Do I have too many colors in my chart? Should I directly label the chart or use a legend? Should line charts include gridlines? This paper addresses these practical questions through a systematic analysis of 53 visualization style guides from diverse organizations. We present the first comprehensive cross-organizational study of visualization guidelines, analyzing recommendations by chart type and visual element. Our findings reveal consensus on certain design principles—such as limiting pie charts to five segments and ensuring color-blind accessibility—while highlighting significant contradictions in other areas, including axis scaling and decorative elements. By mapping these patterns of agreement and divergence, we create an evidence-based reference for practitioners seeking reliable guidance. Beyond cataloging recommendations, we analyze where consensus aligns with empirical research and where organizations prioritize brand consistency over perceptual effectiveness. Additionally, we introduce a searchable repository that enables designers to quickly identify established patterns and potential pitfalls for specific visualization types. This work bridges the gap between fragmented organizational guidelines and evidence-based practices, offering a foundation for more consistent, effective visual communication across disciplines.'
