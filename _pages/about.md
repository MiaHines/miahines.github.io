 I'm a second-year PhD student in Computer Science Department at Washington University in St. Louis. I'm in the [VIBE Lab](https://visualdata.wustl.edu/) with Dr. Alvitta Ottley. I've has been awarded multiple research fellowships including Clare Booth Luce Graduate Fellowship, AI-ACCESS NRT Fellowship, and GEM Associate Fellowship. I earned a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) at Grinnell College in Computer Science and a concentration in Statistics. From my department at Grinnell, I was awarded 2024 Henry M. and Theresa P. Walker Endowed Prize for Excellence in Computer Science. I have served as an undergraduate research assistant in Human-Computer Interaction, Social Computing, and Data Science at Brown University (2022) and MIT (2023). I'm also passionate about academic engagement within my community. I've served as Instructor Assistant at Kode With Klossy (KWK) in March and ran a coding club for local middle school students (2023-2024). Academia in Computer Science is the medium for facilitating the change I want to see in the world.


Research Interests + Current Projects
======
I'm still discovering my overall research topic. But, I'm becoming further interested in mapping specific psychological inferences to visual aspects within a data visualization. However, I'm still spending time in diversifying my interests and exploring various subfields in visualization. I find this will improve my capabilites as a visualization researcher and help to further decide a long-term focus in my Ph.D. I'm currently working on projects related to visualization literacy, visual attention, design guidelines, and social impact. More specifics of my current projects are reported in the following. 
1. Creating a gamified version of visualization literacy assessment to increase data collection of a diverse audiences. 
1. Developing experiments to map visual aspects to attention and types of thinking (naturalistic vs long-term). 
1. Writing a paper on the gaps between practioner design guidelines and empirical evidence found in the literature. 
1. Analyzing how visualizations are used in the news media.
